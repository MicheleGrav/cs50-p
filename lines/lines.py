# In a file called lines.py, implement a program that expects exactly one command-line
# argument, the name (or path) of a Python file, and outputs the number of lines of
# code in that file, excluding comments and blank lines.
# If the user does not specify exactly one command-line argument, or
# if the specified fileâ€™s name does not end in .py, or
# if the specified file does not exist, the program should instead exit via sys.exit.

# Assume that any line that starts with #, optionally preceded by whitespace,
# is a comment. (A docstring should not be considered a comment.)
# Assume that any line that only contains whitespace is blank.
